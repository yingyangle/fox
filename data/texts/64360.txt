A Fore Word:

[Illustration:

    This book is no arithmetic
      To vex the mind of youth;
    Its pages may, perhaps, appear
      To be devoid of truth.
    But by these tales the young who learn
      To recognize a lie,
    To that extent will know the truth,
      And profit much thereby.]

THE PIRATE FROG.


[Illustration:

    Some boys whose names I do not know,
      Went out to sail their boat one day:
    Fast to her stern they tied a line
      So she could not sail far away
    But little did those boys suspect
      That, just beyond a floating log,
    With all his trusty followers,
      There lay in wait the Pirate Frog.]

[Illustration:

    On came the ship; out sprang the frogs—
      A desperate, determined crew.
    They climbed aboard with reckless speed
      And each one found his work to do.
    One cut the line, one raised the flag,
      The captain seized the helm to steer;
    And thus, on peaceful Plunkett’s Pond,
      Began the Pirate Frog’s career.]

[Illustration:

    Upon the shore of Plunkett’s Pond
      Three turtles basked beneath the sun;
    ’Twas afternoon, the spot was warm,
      And they were dozing every one.
    Their eyes were closed, they did not see
      Around the point a sail appear,
    Nor did they know, until too late,
      The dreaded Pirate Frog was near.]

[Illustration:

    The pirate crew made haste to land:
      They ran to where the turtles lay,
    Turned all three quickly on their backs,
      Then, hoisting sail, sped fast away.
    For hours the turtles strained and scratched
      To turn themselves, but all in vain,
    Till Mrs. Muskrat came that way
      And set them right side up again.]

[Illustration:

    As out of Turtle Bay he sailed,
      The Pirate Frog the waters scanned,
    And soon he steered his stolen ship
      To catch some ducklings far from land.
    Around the downy neck of one
      A lasso made of cord he cast,
    And, though the victim struggled hard,
      The cord was strong; the knot held fast.]

[Illustration:

    The other ducklings hurried home,
      When this unequal fight began:
    All breathlessly they told the news
      To Uncle Peter Pelican.
    He hurried out across the pond,
      And first he cut the duckling’s cord;
    Which gave the frightened pirates time
      To dive to safety overboard.]

[Illustration:

    Far up the shores of Plunkett’s Pond,
      Within a deep and marshy bay,
    Amid the rustling rushes green,
      The muskrats’ cozy village lay.
    Now, when the older rats were gone,
      The little ratlings had no fear;
    ’Twould have been different had they known
      The dreaded Pirate Frog was near.]

[Illustration:

    But soon the pirates’ flag was seen—
      The town was taken by surprise.
    One baby rat was caught and bound
      And dragged on ship despite his cries.
    But soon his bonds were gnawed apart
      And he for safety scaled the mast,
    His weight aloft o’erset the ship
      And he laughed best for he laughed last.]

[Illustration:

    ’Twas in July; the sun was hot,
      The pond was smooth, the air was still.
    The Pirate’s vessel lay becalmed
      Without a breeze the sail to fill;
    But soon a plan had been devised
      To move the ship without a sail:
    A diving frog took down a line
      And tied it ’round a bull-head’s tail.]

[Illustration:

    The big fish felt a gentle tug,
      Then saw the line and jumped with fright.
    He tried in vain to shake it off,
      And swam away with all his might.
    This way and that, at race-horse speed,
      He crossed the pond from side to side,
    But where he went the ship went, too,
      And all the frogs enjoyed the ride.]

[Illustration:

    For weeks the wicked Pirate Frog
      Had filled the water folk with fright;
    They hid themselves throughout the day,
      While few dared venture out at night.
    Had he not grown too rash and bold
      They might be living that way still;
    But his career closed when he tried
      To stop the busy water mill.]

[Illustration:

    He planned to drive his stolen ship
      Against the wheel and tie it fast.
    Nor did he think, on starting out,
      That this exploit would be his last.
    Too late he saw his grave mistake,
      He tried in vain to reach the shore—
    The pirates’ ship was ground to bits,
      And Plunkett’s Pond knew them no more.]




[Illustration:

    Old Daddy Longlegs sat him down
        And wept in deepest woe.
    “Alas!” he cried, “The summer’s gone
        “And soon will come the snow.
    “My children beg for warmer clothes,
        “But yet I must refuse
    “For each one has so many feet
        “I can’t buy overshoes.”]




THE HUNGRY PUPIL


[Illustration:

      To the Jungle kindergarten,
    Mrs. Tiger brought her child:
    He was small and roly-poly,
      He was also meek and mild.
    Telling him to mind the teacher,
    Not to pull his playmates hair
      And learn his lessons quickly.
      Then his mother left him there.]

[Illustration:

    When she called for him at noon time,
      He was sitting all alone
    With a smile of satisfaction,
      Gnawing at an ostrich bone.
    All the ground was strewn with feathers
      Well picked bones and bits of fur;
      But the pupils all were missing.
    Don’t you wonder where they were?]




[Illustration:

    Her little son came wriggling up
      To grave old mother Eel;
    “Oh mother dear”, he said with tears
      “Such awful pains I feel.
    “The doctor says he greatly fears
      “For small-pox I am slated;
    “But yet I have no arms or legs,
      “And can’t be vaccinated.”]




[Illustration:

    The Snapping Turtle’s daughter
      In dress displayed good taste;
    But, when she tried a belt on,
      She found she had no waist.]




[Illustration:

      The jolly Rough Riders of wash day
        Sat jauntily out on the line
          Not a man was afraid
        For ’twas but dress parade
    And their showing was certainly fine.]

[Illustration:

    But when from their homes in the tree-tops
      The enemy sailed through the air
        And with coarse, muddy feet
        Soiled each garment and sheet
    The Riders could do naught but stare.]




[Illustration:

    A crocodile made up his mind
      That he’d be clean and neat;
    On land he walked upon his toes,
      So’s not to soil his feet;
    But, when he came to brush his teeth,
    He found to his dismay,
    They were so numerous that he
      Was busy all the day.]




[Illustration:

    Jane Jenkens liked to look her best—
      Though not too proud a girl—
        She “did” her hair with strips of tin
          To make it kink and curl.
            She twisted it too tight by far
              And found, to her surprise,
                That, though she tried her very best,
                  She couldn’t close her eyes.]




A FIRE IN FROGTOWN


[Illustration:

    One sultry night in Frogtown
      The muskrats’ house caught fire;
      The muskrats, with their babies,
    Rushed out in scant attire.]

[Illustration:

    Then all the Frogtown firemen,
      In startled haste arose,
    And ran to put the fire out
      With dandelion hose.]




THE PORCUPINE’S DILEMMA


[Illustration:

    A porcupine once played at golf
      And wore a sweater red.
    “I notice all the swells dress so.
      “And so will I”, he said.]

[Illustration:

    But when he found his stylish clothes
      Were far too warm for golf,
    His sharp quills held that sweater fast
      He couldn’t get it off.]




[Illustration:

    A monkey, sitting on a tree
      Above a shady pool,
      Looked down and saw a crocodile
          Within the water cool.
    The crocodile looked up and said,
      “Come down my friend and swim.”
      Intending, when the monkey came,
          To make a meal of him.]

[Illustration:

    The monkey knew this was his plan
      But leaped as if to dive.
    The crocodile spread wide his jaws
      To catch his meal alive;
    But he was disappointed much
      To see his sharp game fail
    For, as he leaped, the monkey caught
      And hung there by his tail.]




[Illustration:

    One beast there is which should be shunned
        By little girls and boys;
    That is the cross Whine-os-ce-ros,
        Which makes an awful noise.]

[Illustration:

    For if they see this animal
      And do not run away,
    They imitate its shrill, harsh voice
      And whine the livelong day.]




Seein’ Large


[Illustration:

    A frog who wore new spectacles
        Observed a common fly;
    “What monster can this be?” he said,
        “That comes before my eye?”]

[Illustration:

    But when the fly was quickly caught,
        And on the frog’s inside,
    He felt so empty that he knew
        His glasses magnified.]




[Illustration:

    A turtle had a big bass-drum
      On which he used to play;
      His comrades didn’t like the noise,
          And so they ran away.
          He played till he was all tired out,
              Then all his friends returned
          And smashed that drum to kindling wood,
                Which they piled up and burned.]

[Illustration]




[Illustration:

    When Robert Pip put out to sea,
      His ship was strong and new;
    He was the captain proud and bold,
      He also was the crew.
    And he could reef and splice and clew
      And yaw and luff and steer.
    For food he carried chocolate drops;
      His drink was ginger beer.]

[Illustration:

    The course as steered by Captain Pip
      Was sou’ sou’ west by east;
    And he had sailed upon his way
      For forty days at least,
    When up there came a tidal wave
      And, with a rush and roar,
    Picked up his ship and landed it
      Fast on a foreign shore.]

[Illustration:

    When Robert Pip’s ill fated ship
      Was landed high and dry
    Upon a flat and unknown shore,
      The shades of night were nigh:
    So down he lay to take his rest
      Upon the vessel’s deck,
    Observing that his food and drink
      Were safe, despite the wreck.]

[Illustration:

    The sun was up when he awoke
      And, on a hillock near,
    He saw a group of monkey folk
      Who showed no signs of fear.
    They seemed polite, well bred and kind—
      He wished to make them friends
    And, by the means of chocolate drops,
      He soon had gained his ends.]

[Illustration:

    The monkeys met by Captain Pip
      Were all one family,
    Who, near the place where he was wrecked,
      Dwelt in a banyan tree.
    They took him to their lofty home
      And urged that he should stay;
        And he consented, for he knew
          He could not sail away.]

[Illustration:

    Within a week he learned their ways
        And spoke their language, too;
    He climbed with ease the tallest trees
        Where dates and cocoas grew.
    The father monkey and his wife
        Rejoiced in children three—
    Strong Reginald and Rufus, sons,
        A daughter named Marie.]

[Illustration:

    With Rufus and with Reginald,
      Bob Pip went out one day
    To find a place for golfing grounds
      And teach his friends to play.
    For clubs they used the bamboo sprouts,
      In near-by jungles found;
    For balls they plucked young cocoanuts,
      Green, hard and small and round.]

[Illustration:

    The monkey boys soon learned the game
      And, with the greatest ease,
    Could drive the ball from hole to hole,
      O’er brooks and rocks and trees.
    They swung their clubs with hand or foot,
      Or tail—’twas all the same.
    And soon they beat the Captain
      At this ancient, royal game.]

[Illustration:

    Within the chest of Captain Pip
      A bag of marbles lay;
    He fished them out one afternoon
      And taught his friends to play.
    They played the game of “little-ring”
      Upon the hard beach near
    Until there came a sad mishap
      As you shall straightway hear.]

[Illustration:

    For, as Marie was standing by,
      There rolled close to her feet
    A china “shooter” that indeed
      Looked good enough to eat.
    She snatched it up to swallow it;
      It caught—she choked—turned pale.
    To save her life they hung her up
      By her prehensile tail.]

[Illustration:

    Upon a sunny stretch of sand
        That lay beside the sea,
    The father monkey went to stroll
        And with him went Marie.
    She, running on ahead of him,
        Cried out: “For goodness sake:
    “Oh, father dear, come quickly here
        “And kill this horrid snake.”]

[Illustration:

    He quickly grasped a driftwood club
        And reached his daughter’s side;
    But when he saw that serpent strange,
        He, too, was terrified.
    He shook with fright, but soon he found
        That what had made him quail,
    Was Rufus buried in the sand—
        All hid except his tail.]

[Illustration:

    Now Captain Pip so longed for home,
      He sought his stranded boat.
    New rigging here, some patches there
      He thought would make her float.
    His mind was speedily made up;
      His new idea was tried,
    And soon his ship, all staunch again,
      Rode proudly on the tide.]

[Illustration:

    His monkey friends wept bitterly
      At losing Captain Pip,
    Till finally Marie ran home
      To pack her little grip;
    And when she said, “I’m going, too.”
      They all made haste to pack:
    Then boarded ship and sailed away,
      Nor to that isle came back.]




[Illustration:

    There was an old school teacher bear
    Whom a fever had robbed of his hair;
        And the thought of his loss
        Made him peevish and cross
    To the cubs who were under his care.]

[Illustration:

    So they bought him a bottle or two
    Of a medicine famous and new;
        Then his hair grew so fast,
        That the old bear at last
    Had to braid it all up in a queue.]




[Illustration:

    Small Wee-Wip was an Indian
      Who, in a wigwam warm,
    Dwelt snugly all the winter through
      Quite safe from frost and storm.
    But he had heard of Santa Claus
      And so, when Christmas came,
    He hung his deerskin moccasins
      Upon the wigwam frame.]

[Illustration:

    And sure enough, the good, old saint
      That night came jingling by;
    And, as he passed, the moccasins
      Caught his observing eye.
    But wigwams have no chimneys tall
      Through which old Kriss can drop,
    So Wee-Wip’s Christmas gifts were left
      Upon the wigwam top.]




[Illustration:

    Young Billy Hedgehog wished a nap;
        He found an easy chair
    And, snugly curling up in it,
        He soon forgot all care.]

[Illustration:

    Grave old Judge Bruin wished to read,
        For books were to his taste;
    In that same chair he sat him down
        But rose again in haste.]




[Illustration:

    A little girl Mermaid sat down by the sea,
      And mournful, dejected and tearful was she;
    She wanted a shirtwaist all ironed stiff and nice,
      But the ocean would take out the starch in a trice.]

[Illustration:

    And she wanted blue shoes, for she thought them “so sweet,”
      So she sobbed out afresh for she saw she’d no feet.
    And she wept, and she wailed, and she sobbed, and she sighed,
      Till her tears added salt to the salty sea’s tide.]

[Illustration:

        The little girl Mermaid dove down in the sea,
    The crabs and the lobster folk hailed her with glee;
    The squids, shrimps and starfish stood up in a row,
        To welcome her back to her home down below.]

[Illustration:

      Behind her sea-horses she went for a ride
    Where brilliant hued ocean plants swayed in the tide.
    ’Twas pleasant indeed, and she thought with regret
      That once she had wished to live out of the wet.]

[Illustration:

    The little girl Mermaid once bade her friends all
      To come to a beautiful fancy dress ball.
      The Fiddler Crabs fiddled for waltzes and reels
    Which were gracefully danced by Squids, Lobsters and Eels.]

[Illustration:

    The Flounders were awkward; they floundered about
      Till Swordfish policemen escorted them out.
      But with this exception, the ball had no flaw
    And the Sawfish declared ’twas the best he e’er saw.]




The Proud Wishbone


[Illustration:

    The wishbone was a haughty thing
      And high he held his head;
    The Wing twins were but “common trash,”
      And Drumsticks too, he said.
    “It’s just as plain as anything
      “That this is so,” quoth he,
    “For there are two of each of them
      “But only one of _Me_.”]

[Illustration:

    And when two children at the feast
      Each for the wishbone cried
    The Wishbone said “I told you so”
      And oh, he swelled with pride.
    They took him each one by a foot
      As children often do,
    Then each one gave a sudden tug
      And broke him right in two.]




[Illustration:

        There was a dancing camel with a desert caravan;
      His driver was a busy and an un-esthetic man,
    Who made the camel work all day and gave him ne’er a chance
        To lay his heavy load aside and do a fancy dance.]

[Illustration:

    But when they reached a city and heard street musicians play,
      The camel danced a step or two while jogging on his way,
      And quickly people thronged about to wonder and to stare,
    While the driver passed the hat and made his fortune then and there.]




[Illustration:

    Young George Augustus William Bubb
        Was far too dignified
      To play at games like other boys—
        They grated on his pride.
    He did not know how kites are made,
        Nor how to play at ball,
    Nor how to skate, nor how to swim,
        Nor anything at all.]




[Illustration:

    Said Mrs. Robin breathlessly
      “The frosts are nearly due,
      This moving south is troublesome,
        The baggage heavy, too.”
    Said Mr. Rob, “Oh, that’s all right,
        We’ll bill the baggage through.”]




THE HAUGHTY COW


[Illustration:

    Said an acrobatic monkey
      To the staid and stately cow:
    “Come let us turn some handsprings;
    “I will quickly show you how.”
        But old bossy shook her head,
        “No indeed!” she sharply said,
    “I have passed the age of nonsense
        “And I’ll not begin it now.”]




THE PEANUT BIRD


[Illustration:

    Deep in the forest, dark and still,
      There lives the peanut bird;
    It rarely walks, it seldom flies,
      Its song is never heard.
    No fear of hunters armed with salt
      Will make this bird turn pale;
    It can’t be caught with salt you see,
      Because it has no tail.]




THE DISAPPOINTED BAT


[Illustration:

    A bat played a hand organ out in the street,
      And carried a sign “I AM BLIND”;
    But though all his music was joyous and sweet,
      His hearers, he thought, were unkind;
    For no-one who passed dropped a coin in his hat,
    But each said “Why of course; he’s as blind as a bat.”]




[Illustration:

    When Billy Wilson swimming went,
      It took him half a day
        To reach the lake because, you see,
          It was so far away.
        And so, to stop this loss of time,
          When next he went to swim
            He tied a string around the lake,
              And pulled it home with him.]




DICKIE PEG-LEG


[Illustration:

    A sparrow with a wooden leg
    Hopped o’er a roof of tin;
    And, as he hopped, a girl below
      Was overcome with sudden woe
        To hear that noise begin.]

[Illustration:

    “Oh dear,” she cried, “here comes the rain,
    “And this is picnic day.”
      Nor did she know what she had heard
      Was just a wooden legged bird
      Until he flew away.]




[Illustration:

    Young Johnny Bingle long had wished
        To own a “truly” gun,
    And so, when Christmas came again,
        His father gave him one.
    It had a barrel straight and true
        A fancy walnut stock
    And for his first game Johnny shot
        The cuckoo in the clock.]




THE SHANGHAI TWINS.


[Illustration:

    As Mother Bantam roamed the field,
      Of worms and bugs in quest,
        She found two large and lonesome eggs
          In a deserted nest.
            “This makes my duty clear” said she,
              “I’ll stay and hatch them out.”
                And for three weeks that little hen
                  Was no more seen about.]

[Illustration:

    At length from out those two large eggs
      The young chicks broke their way;
        And thus the famous Shanghai Twins
          First saw the light of day
            And Mother Bantam stood aghast
              That newborn pair to see
                For, standing in his stocking feet,
                  Each was as tall as she.]

[Illustration:

      When Mother Bantam came to feed
        The hungry Shanghai Twins,
    She found she had an awful task
        To fill them to their chins;
    And, if they were not filled that full,
        They clamored to be fed;
      Until in running down their food
        She worked till nearly dead.]

[Illustration:

    With hoppers and with lady bugs,
      With moths and worms and flies,
    With grains of corn and crumbs of bread
      She stopped their hungry cries.
    Till finally she ran so much
        To get them food to eat,
    That she herself, worn out and starved,
        Was overcome by heat.]

[Illustration:

    Said Mother Bantam to her twins:
      “Since you two have been hatched,
    “You have not found a single meal,
      “You have not run nor scratched;
    “I’ve fed you as a mother should,
      “But you are stronger now
    “And henceforth you must scratch for worms.”
      Cried they: “Please show us how.”]

[Illustration:

    She led them to the garden plot,
        “Dig in your claws” said she,
    “Just catch the dirt and push it back.
        “It’s easy; don’t you see?”
    “Ah yes,” they cried and went to work
        With all their main and might,
    And, ere they knew what they had done,
        They buried her from sight.]

[Illustration:

    The Shanghai Twins came on apace;
        So rapidly they grew,
    That larger, stronger fowls than they
        Became extremely few.
    And Mother Bantam gazed with pride
        Her foster sons upon:
    The one of them was christened James,
        The other one was John.]

[Illustration:

    Beneath the battered hen-house door,
        A hungry fox one night
    Poked in his nose, and all the fowls
        Were paralyzed with fright.
    But James and John knew what to do,
        They fought with might and main
    Until the fox took to his heels
        With yelps of fear and pain.]

[Illustration:

    Now when the valiant Shanghai Twins
          Had put a fox to flight,
    They stood on guard to watch the house
          The balance of the night
    And, while they watched, the other fowls
          Reposed in perfect peace:
    So, after that, the Twins were named
          As poultry yard police.]

[Illustration:

    Each wore, to show his lofty rank,
        A helmet, club and star,
    And soon as faithful guardians
        Their fame spread near and far.
    The very mention of their names,
        Made thieving fowls turn pale
    For well they knew that John and James
        Could march them off to jail.]




[Illustration:

    Three young and interesting pigs
      Once lived within a sty;
    And one was greedy, one was strong,
    And one was scarce a half yard long
      And scant ten inches high.]

[Illustration:

    The greedy one, when large and fat,
      Was led away one day;
    The strong one rooted at his pen
    Until he made a hole, and then
      Crept out and ran away.

    The smallest pig, with careful thought,
      Made up his mind to stay.
    He did not eat enough to grow,
    He did not run away, and so
      He lives in peace today.]




“ONCE ON A TIME.”


[Illustration:

    If you had lived “once on a time,”
      Just as the story books all say,
      Oh wouldn’t it have been a sight
    To see the knights with dragons fight
      And bear their heads away.]

[Illustration:

    And it was “once upon a time,”
    That little boys came to be kings;
    That fairies flitted here and there
    To little girls with presents rare—
    Rich gowns and diamond rings.

    But now, dear me, how things are changed:
    And yet, perhaps, ’tis just as well:
    For, if ’twere not so long ago,
    That all these wondrous things were so,
    There’d be no tales to tell.]




[Illustration:

    To Mr. Fox’s barber shop,
    The large important Mr. Bear
    Once took his chubby, little son
    To have the barber trim his hair.]

[Illustration:

    The cloth was tucked about his neck
      When, in the mirror large and tall,
      He chanced to see another bear
    And cuffed the glass to pieces small.]




[Illustration:

      Perhaps there is a funny land
    Where rabbits dress in long tailed coats,
      And kittens all wear wooden shoes
    And schools are taught by learned goats.]

[Illustration:

      Where crocodiles play violins
    And owls are decked in gowns and caps;
      But if there is a land like this,
    You can not find it on the maps.]




[Illustration:

    A very foolish little clam
      Each night sat up till very late;
    His parents said repeatedly
      That he should not thus dissipate.
    But he would never heed their words:
      He was too headstrong to obey
    And thus he had so little sleep
      That he was sleepy all the day.]

[Illustration:

    One summer morning on the beach,
      He opened wide his shell to yawn.
    A big red bird came walking by—
      A snap, a gulp—the clam was gone!
    So, children, though you are too large
      For any hungry bird to hold,
    You see ’tis much the wiser plan
      To go to bed when you are told.]




THE AIRSHIPS


[Illustration:

    The airship fleet of Meadowville
      Floats gaily o’er the town;
      For older people fully grown,
        The craft is thistle down.
          The smaller of the meadow folk
            On fluffy silk-weed ride:
            And there’s a ship for every one
        With ships to spare, beside.]

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
