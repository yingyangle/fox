How the Enemy Craft of Pirate Fox was Sunk
------------------------------------------

1. Once upon a time Curly and Floppy Twistytail, the two piggie boys,
thought they would play the game of Pirate. They whittled out some
wooden swords and made a wooden raft. On the raft they set sail across
the duck pond ocean. “We’ll sail over to Uncle Wiggily’s bungalow and
capture him,” grunted Curly. “What do we do after we capture him?” asked
Floppy. “Hold him for a ransom,” said Curly.

2. Uncle Wiggily, standing on shore, was surprised when the two piggie
boys leaped off their raft and captured him. “What’s all this, boys?” he
asked, twinkling his pink nose. “We are Pirates and we have captured
you,” grunted Floppy. “And you can’t get away until you pay us a ransom
of ten lollypops!” squealed Curly. So they tied Uncle Wiggily to the
mast. The bunny gentleman laughed at the fun.

3. The Fox and Wolf, hidden on shore, watched Curly and Floppy playing
at being Pirates and capturing Uncle Wiggily. “We could do that,”
growled the Wolf. “Do what?” asked the Fox. “Dress up and pretend to be
Pirates,” answered the Wolf. “Those pigs will soon tire of the game. We
can take their raft, sneak up and get Uncle Wiggily. He’ll think it is
all in fun and, before he knows it, we’ll have him!”

4. The Wolf was right. In a little while Curly and Floppy let Uncle
Wiggily go, for the piggie boys became tired of playing the Pirate game.
Uncle Wiggily gave them lollypops for a ransom. Then, while the piggie
boys went to play ball, and while Uncle Wiggily was asleep on the shore,
the Fox and Wolf, dressed like Pirates, and pretending to be friendly
animal boys, sneaked up to capture the bunny.

5. Before Uncle Wiggily was quite awake, the Fox and Wolf had caught him
and dragged him on the piggie boys’ raft which the bad animals took.
“Ha! Ha!” laughed Uncle Wiggily, when he saw what had happened. “This is
a good joke! You look just like real pirates, Curly and Floppy. But why
have you put on false faces? You didn’t do that at first. “Come, we’ve
had enough fun! Let’s go ashore!”

6. After a while Curly and Floppy grew tired of playing ball. They went
down to the shore of the duck pond ocean to get their raft once more,
but it was gone. “Oh, look!” squealed Floppy. “The Fox and Wolf have
taken our raft. They dressed up as Pirates, like us, and have captured
Uncle Wiggily! What shall we do?” Curly looked at the boat on shore. “To
the rescue! We must sink the enemy craft!”

7. No sooner said than done! Into the boat jumped Curly and Floppy.
“We’ll make believe this piece of stove pipe is a cannon,” said Floppy.
“And we’ll use cabbages, turnips and carrots for cannon balls!” His
brother said that was a good idea, and off they started after the raft,
which the Fox and Wolf were sailing away, taking Uncle Wiggily with
them. By this time the bunny knew he was in danger.

8. Straight toward the pirate raft went the boat. “Surrender!” cried
Floppy. “Give us back Uncle Wiggily or we’ll sink you!” The Fox and Wolf
rushed wildly about. “We ought to have guns!” howled the Fox. “Well, we
haven’t any!” snarled the Wolf. Floppy blew talcum powder through the
stove pipe cannon and threw cabbages, turnips and carrots until the Fox
and Wolf were ready to jump overboard.

9. One big cabbage hit the mast of the raft and broke it. A lot of
turnips knocked apart the craft of the Pirate Fox and Wolf. Into the
water leaped the bad chaps, hit all over with sharp carrots. “We’ll save
you, Uncle Wiggily! We’ll save you!” called Floppy and Curly. They took
the rabbit gentleman into the boat with them and rowed him safely to
shore, while the Fox and Wolf clung to the broken raft.




  And if the grasshopper doesn’t tickle the fountain pen under the chin
       and make it spill ink on the cocoanut cake, the next pictures
                       and story will tell how

                      IT’S LOTS OF FUN TO GATHER
                  NUTS AND ROAST THEM AT A FIRE. BUT
         WHEN THEY CALL UPON YOUR HEAD IT’S TIME THEN TO RETIRE.




The Bob Cat Nearly Spoiled a Nutting Party
------------------------------------------

1. One day Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrel boys, ran over to
Uncle Wiggily’s hollow stump bungalow. “Please come nutting with us,
Uncle Wiggily!” chattered the squirrels. “The nuts ate late this year.
We’ll find the trees loaded.” So while Uncle Wiggily held his tall silk
hat beneath a chestnut tree, the squirrel boys knocked nuts into-it.
“We’ll have a nut party!” laughed the bunny gentleman.

2. “We ought to have more than one kind of nuts at a party!” cried
Johnnie, when the bunny’s hat was nearly full. “I know where there’s a
hazel bush!” said Billie. “Let’s go there!” proposed Uncle Wiggily. And
when the three friends reached the hazel nut bush, the wind was blowing
so hard that it blew the nuts off the bush and into the bunny’s hat, and
the caps of the squirrel chaps. It was jolly fun!

3. “Haven’t we enough nuts now for a little party?” asked Johnnie. “I
think so,” answered Uncle Wiggily. “We’ll make a little camp fire on a
big rock in the woods, and roast the chestnuts. The hazel nuts do not
need roasting.” Soon a jolly party was gathered around the camp fire.
Just then along came the sneaky Bob Cat. “Oh ho!” said the Bob Cat to
himself, “I guess I’ll have some ears to nibble now!”

4. All of a sudden, while Uncle Wiggily and the squirrels were roasting
the nuts, up sprang the Bob Cat. Before the bunny could do anything he
was caught and tied in a wild grape vine, and so were the squirrel boys.
“I’ll take you off to my den,” said the bad Bob Cat, “and I’ll nibble
your ears when I get you there!” Uncle Wiggily begged and pleaded, but
the Bob Cat would not let him loose. Oh, dear!

5. On his way to his den the Bob Cat led Uncle Wiggily and the two
squirrels beneath a horse chestnut tree. Then Johnnie had an idea. He
quickly whispered to Uncle Wiggily while the Bob Cat was looking the
other way. Then the squirrel boy said: “Oh, Mr. Bob Cat, here are some
fine big nuts! Wouldn’t you like us to get you some of these nuts before
you nibble our ears?” The Bob Cat said he thought he would.

6. “If you loosen us we'll climb up and get you some great big horse
chestnuts!” chattered the squirrels to the Bob Cat. They didn’t tell him
horse chestnuts weren’t good to eat. “Very well,” snarled the Bob Cat.
“I'll loosen you long enough to have you get me some nuts. But I'll tie
Uncle Wiggily fast to the tree trunk,” and this was done. “We'll jiggle
nuts on the Bob Cat,” said Billie to Johnnie, whispering.

7. All of a sudden, when the Bob Cat was right under big clusters of the
sharp, stickery nuts, the squirrel boys began shaking down the horse
chestnuts. “Bing! Bang! Bung!” they fell all over the Bob Cat, pricking
him like a dozen pin cushions. “Stop! Stop! That’s enough!” howled the
bad chap. But Johnnie and Billie danced the harder, sending down more
prickery nuts to stick the Bob Cat. None hit the bunny.

8. Johnnie and Billie shook down so many of the big horse chestnuts in
their stickery green husks, that the Bob Cat was covered almost over his
head. Every time the Bob Cat moved and tried to get out from beneath the
nuts, they only pricked him the harder. “Oh, wow!” howled the bad chap!
“Come on!” cried Johnnie to Billie as they scrambled down the tree.
“Let’s untie Uncle Wiggily and run!”

9. While the Bob Cat was trying to crawl out from beneath the pile of
stickery horse chestnuts, Johnnie and Billie quickly loosened the grape
vine ropes from around Uncle Wiggily. None of the sharp nuts had fallen
on the bunny gentleman. “Good-bye, old Bob Cat!” cried the squirrel
boys, as they tossed a few more nuts on the pile, to make sure the bad
chap wouldn’t get out and chase them. But he couldn't!




  And if the egg beater doesn’t try to turn the rubber plant into an
       umbrella for the gold fish, the next pictures and story
                          will tell how

               UNCLE WIGGILY WENT ONE DAY, HIS BASKET
            TO FILL WITH FLOWERS OF MAY. AND, THOUGH HE
       GATHERED BLOSSOMS BRIGHT, HE ALSO HAD A TERRIBLE FIGHT.




Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane Gather May Flowers
-----------------------------------------------

1. One day Uncle Wiggily invited Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy to come with him
to the woods. “We shall gather a basket of May flowers,” said the bunny
rabbit. “Yes, and I suppose I shall catch cold and have the
sniffle-snuffles,” laughed the muskrat lady housekeeper. “But, come
along. Perhaps we shall have some adventures.” So, in the woods, the
bunny gentleman and Nurse Jane gathered flowers.

2. “I see some red flowers over here,” said Nurse Jane, after a time.
“I’m going to pick them.” She moved away from Uncle Wiggily. But while
the bunny was filling his basket, suddenly Nurse Jane came running back
all out of breath. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” she gasped. “The Skillery
Scallery Alligator is crawling after me! What shall I do?” Uncle Wiggily
twinkled his pink nose and said: “Let me think!”

3. Surely enough, while Uncle Wiggily was thinking and twinkling his
pink nose, along came the Skillery Scallery Alligator with humps on his
tail. “Well, Uncle Wiggily,” cried Nurse Jane, “Have you thought of
anything yet?” The bunny rabbit quickly jumped along with his basket of
flowers, at the same time grasping Nurse Jane’s paw. “Yes,” he said, “I
think we had better run! Come on!”

4. But though Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane ran very fast, the ’Gator
still came on after them, and at last the muskrat lady said: “We shall
never escape. You had better think again, Uncle Wiggily.” So the bunny
rabbit did. He saw an old stump, covered with toad stools. “I’ll make
myself look like a stump,” he said to Nurse Jane, “and you cover
yourself with blossoms so you look like a flower bed.”

5. Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane disguised themselves, and only just in
time. Along came the Alligator. “Well,” he growled, “I thought I saw
Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane, but I must have made a mistake. All I see
is an old stump or two and a bed of flowers. I can’t eat them. I want
ears to nibble!” The Alligator ambled away and Uncle Wiggily and Nurse
Jane stood up and thankfully shook paws. Wait a moment!

6. The rabbit gentleman and Nurse Jane had no more than stopped their
hearts from beating wildly, than the muskrat lady said: “Hark! I think
some other bad animal is coming!” And, surely enough, along stalked the
Woozie Wolf. “Come on!” whispered Uncle Wiggily to Nurse Jane. “We must
run again, I think!” Nurse Jane said the same thing. “We’re not getting
many flowers for your May basket,” she said.

7. Suddenly, right in the path of Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane appeared
a pond of water. “Oh, dear me! We're caught!” cried the muskrat lady.
“You can’t swim, Wiggy, and we haven’t time to run around the pond. What
shall we do?” Uncle Wiggily twinkled his pink nose. “We’ll wade into the
pond and pretend to be water lilies. We'll come out after the Wolf
passes. He’ll think we’re May blossoms.”

8. Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane waded into the pond, crouching down and
hiding every bit of themselves but their faces. Their faces they held
flat on the water trying to make themselves look like pond lilies. Up
came the hungry Wolf. “Well, I think I had better get myself some
glasses,” growled the bad chap. “I thought sure I saw Uncle Wiggily and
Nurse Jane, but here are only leaves and lilies.”

9. When the old Wolf slunk away, Nurse Jane and Uncle Wiggily crawled
out of the pond. “I suppose you'll scold me, Nurse Jane, for making so
much trouble with my May basket and getting you all wet,” spoke the
bunny rabbit. “Oh, not at all! Not at all!” laughed the muskrat lady. “I
had quite a jolly time! I am all wet and we haven't any flowers in the
basket. But we fooled the Wolf and 'Gator!”

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
