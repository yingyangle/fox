[Illustration]

1. One day when Uncle Wiggily was out early to see the sun rise, he
passed a rocky ledge from which hung many icicles. As the sun shone
on the sticks of ice they turned all the colors of the rainbow. “How
wonderful!” exclaimed the bunny. “Who made them?” A little chap beside
him said: “I did! I am Jack Frost. And, because you have been kind to me,
I’ll give you the power to make icicles!”

[Illustration]

2. “Whenever you wish to make icicles,” Jack Frost told Uncle Wiggily,
“just push the squirt gun. Out will come water, and by magic power it
will freeze into icicles.” The bunny thought this would be fine. So he
hopped through the woods. Soon he came to a deep ravine he wished to
cross, but there was no bridge and it was a long way around. “I’ll try
Jack Frost’s trick now,” said Uncle Wiggily.

[Illustration]

3. Out of the magic Jack Frost gun squirted water. It fell and froze,
making a bridge of icicles across the gully. “Ha! This is just fine!”
laughed Uncle Wiggily, crossing the ice bridge. He did not see the bad
Fox looking after him. “What game is that rabbit up to now?” growled the
Fox. “I must follow and see. He has made a bridge where there was none
before. I can cross after him and catch him!”

[Illustration]

4. Having crossed the icicle bridge, Uncle Wiggily kept on until he came
to the home of Uncle Butter the goat. “Help me down, Uncle Wiggily!” he
bleated. “I was mending a leak in my roof, and the Old Fox came along and
took my ladder.” The bunny said he would help his friend, and pointed the
squirt gun. “Oh, I said HELP me—not SHOOT me!” cried Uncle Butter, and
Mr. Longears just laughed.

[Illustration]

5. “I’m not going to shoot you!” said Uncle Wiggily. “This is Jack
Frost’s magic icicle gun. I’ll make a ladder for you!” So the bunny did,
and the goat gentleman came safely down. The Bad Old Fox, who had stolen
the ladder away, thinking it would help him catch Uncle Wiggily, peeked
around the corner. “I wonder how I can get that rabbit?” thought the Fox,
as the bunny was about to hop on.

[Illustration]

6. After having helped Uncle Wiggily down off the roof, the bunny
traveled on with the magic Jack Frost squirt gun. Soon he came to where
Mrs. Twistytail the pig lady lived. “Oh such trouble!” squealed the pig
lady. “My clothes sticks are gone and all my nice clean clothes will sag
down in the dirt!” Uncle Wiggily made ready the gun. “I’ll freeze some
icicle clothes sticks for you, Mrs. Twistytail,” he said.

[Illustration]

7. “Icicle clothes sticks! I never heard of such things!” squealed
Floppy, the little piggie chap who was using the rake to help his mother
hold up the line. “It can’t be done!” declared Curly. “I’ll soon show
you!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. He squirted three or four streams of water
up in the air. When the water froze it turned into icicles, and the pig
lady used them to hold up the sagging lines.

[Illustration]

8. Having done a kind act for Mrs. Twistytail, by making icicle clothes
sticks Uncle Wiggily hopped along. He was tramping through the woods
when, all of a sudden, the bad Fuzzy Fox ran out from behind a bush. “Now
I have you!” he howled. “You can’t get away!” Uncle Wiggily pointed his
magic gun. “Ha! Ha! I’m not afraid of a bit of water!” snickered the Fox.
“You can’t do anything!”

[Illustration]

9. All of a sudden Uncle Wiggily began to squirt streams of water from
Jack Frost’s magic gun. Up and down the bunny made icicles in the air,
their ends resting on the ground, until he had made a cage with bars of
ice all about the Fox. “Let’s see you get me now!” laughed the bunny, as
he started for his bungalow. “Fooled again!” howled the Fox. “Who would
think he could freeze me in like this?”




Now if the tacks in the carpet don’t turn upside down and tickle the toes
of the pussy cat when she’s dancing for the rag doll, the next pictures
and story will be about Uncle Wiggily’s queer Umbrellas.

[Illustration]

UNCLE WIGGILY WAS SO VERY KIND HE LOANED HIS UMBRELLA. AND WHEN THE
’GATOR CAME ALONG, THE BUNNY FED THE HUNGRY “FELLAH.” REALLY HE DID!

[Illustration]

1. Uncle Wiggily hopped out one day to have an adventure, and, as it
looked cloudy when he started he took his umbrella. The rabbit gentleman
had not hopped very long before it began to April shower. “I’ll just
hoist my umbrella,” said the bunny. He was going along when he noticed
Aunt Lettie, the goat lady, without an umbrella. “Oh, please take mine!”
begged the bunny. “I like to get wet!”

[Illustration]

2. “Oh, thank you!” bleated Aunt Lettie. “But can’t we both walk under
this umbrella?” Uncle Wiggily said no, as he wasn’t going her way. The
bunny was getting quite wet when up hopped Mr. Croaker. “Here is a large
toadstool for you, Uncle Wiggily,” grunted Mr. Croaker. “You may use that
for an umbrella. I am used to the rain.” Uncle Wiggily thanked the toad,
and looked at Mrs. Twistytail.

[Illustration]

3. Uncle Wiggily had not been under the toadstool umbrella very long
before Mrs. Twistytail, the pig lady, came along, with nothing to keep
the April showers off her new bonnet. “Oh, please take this toadstool!”
begged the rabbit uncle. “I don’t need it.” Mrs. Twistytail said he was
very kind, and invited him to walk under it with her, but he was going
the other way. “I like to get wet,” he said politely.

[Illustration]

4. Uncle Wiggily hopped along in the rain without an umbrella, when,
all of a sudden, he heard a voice say: “Quack! Quack! Quack! Come over
here, Mr. Longears, and I’ll give you a Japanese parasol we don’t need.
We ducks just live in the water.” The bunny thanked Mrs. Wibblewobble.
Just as Uncle Wiggily raised the paper umbrella, which kept off the rain,
along came Mrs. Cluck Cluck the hen.

[Illustration]

5. “Oh, please, Mrs. Cluck Cluck, take this Japanese parasol that Mrs.
Wibblewobble loaned me!” cried Uncle Wiggily to the hen lady when he saw
she was getting all wet. “Oh, but I’ll be robbing you!” cackled Mrs.
Cluck Cluck. “Nonsense!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. “I don’t mind April
showers. Besides, maybe, I can get under the pan with this kind dog I see
coming along. Keep dry, Mrs. Cluck Cluck!”

[Illustration]

6. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” barked the ragged but polite tramp dog. “It won’t
do for you to get wet. Take my umbrella! I made it out of an old dishpan
I found, and a broom stick. It will keep you dry. As for me, I’ll stand
out in the rain, and wash my clothes that way.” Uncle Wiggily thanked the
tramp dog, and just then, the bunny saw Mrs. Bushytail, the squirrel lady
coming. “I must help her,” he thought.

[Illustration]

7. Uncle Wiggily had no sooner stepped under the pan umbrella than along
came Mrs. Bushytail. The squirrel lady was getting all wet. “Oh, my
dear Mrs. Bushytail!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “Pray allow me! This isn’t a
stylish umbrella, but it will keep off the wet.” And the bunny stood in
the April shower as Mrs. Bushytail scrambled off. Then out of his house
with some pancakes came Mr. Stubtail, the nice bear.

[Illustration]

8. “Look here, Uncle Wiggily!” said Mr. Stubtail. “There is no need of
you getting wet. Here are some very tough pancakes my wife made. I can’t
eat them; rain won’t hurt them. Fasten them on a stick and they’ll keep
off the rain.” The bunny, thanking the bear, did this. And Uncle Wiggily
was hopping along through the rain with his pancake umbrella when out
popped the Skillery Scallery Alligator.

[Illustration]

9. “Wait a minute!” grunted the Alligator. “Oh, no!” answered Uncle
Wiggily. “I know what you want—my ears!” The ’Gator growled: “Well, I’m
so hungry I must eat something! Stand still until I get you!” But Uncle
Wiggily wouldn’t do that. “Here, nibble some of Mrs. Stubtail’s griddle
cakes!” he cried. “They are so tough you can chew on them for a week and
I can get away!” Then the sun came out.




And if the Circus elephant doesn’t take the wheels off the lion’s cage to
make a pair of roller skates for the camel, the next pictures and story
will be about Uncle Wiggily’s Lemonade Stand.

[Illustration]

LEMONADE SHOULD BE SOUR, AND NOT MADE TOO SWEET. BUT UNCLE WIGGILY’S KIND
SWEPT THE FOX OFF HIS FEET! AND IT SERVED HIM RIGHT, I THINK.

[Illustration]

1. One day, as Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy opened the kitchen door in the
hollow stump bungalow, she saw Uncle Wiggily squeezing juice from a
lemon. “Oh, Wiggy! Are you making a lemon pie?” asked the muskrat lady.
Just then some of the sour juice squirted in her eye and she squirmed
like an angle worm. “I guess I made a mistake that time!” sadly said the
bunny. “But I am trying to make lemonade.”

[Illustration]

2. After Uncle Wiggily had helped Nurse Jane wipe the lemon juice out
of her eye with the towel, the muskrat lady asked: “Why are you making
lemonade, Uncle Wiggily?” The bunny gentleman said that some of the
animal children wanted to start a lemonade stand, so they could sell cool
drinks on hot days and give the money to the Fresh Air Fund for Poor
Animal Children. So the stand was started.

[Illustration]

3. Uncle Wiggily helped Nannie the girl goat, and Curly the pig to
make lemonade to sell from a street stand. The first customer was Mr.
Stubtail, the bear gentleman. Nannie handed him a glass, and when no
one was looking the piggie boy took some lemonade. I’m not saying that
was right, though. “We hope you like our lemonade, Mr. Stubtail.” said
Nannie. “Please bring Neddie and Beckie to our stand.”

[Illustration]

4. “I’ll drink this lemonade.” said Mr. Stubtail, “and then I’ll go get
Neddie and Beckie and treat them.” He put the glass to his lips, but, no
sooner had he taken a sip, than he dropped the glass and roared: “Oh,
burr-r-r-r-r! Wuff! Wow!” Uncle Wiggily wanted to know what was the
matter, and Nannie and the piggie boy were surprised. “Too sour! Too
sour!” howled Mr. Stubtail. “I like sweet lemonade!”

[Illustration]

5. Nannie ran in to Uncle Wiggily’s bungalow and brought out some
sugar, which she poured into the lemonade, while the piggie boy stirred
it ’round and ’round. “I guess this will be all right for our next
customer,” spoke Uncle Wiggily. Soon along came Curly’s father, Mr.
Twistytail. He tasted some of the Fresh Air lemonade. “Oh, ugh! Bunk!” he
grunted. “It’s quite too SWEET! I like lemonade sour!”

[Illustration]

6. “Our customers are getting mixed in our lemonade,” said Uncle Wiggily
to Nannie and Curly, as he sent them to the store to get more lemons.
“I’ll mark each pail so I’ll know which is sweet and which is sour
lemonade.” So the bunny marked a large S on one pail, to show it was
sweet. And he marked a large S on the other pail to show that it was
sour. “Now everything will be fine!” said the bunny.

[Illustration]

7. All at once Uncle Wiggily happened to think that just the letters on
the pails weren’t enough. “I can’t tell Sweet from Sour, as each begins
with the letter S,” said the bunny. “I wonder what I’d better do?” Just
then the bad Fuzzy Fox and the worse Woozie Wolf sprang out of the
bushes. “You’d better keep still while we nibble your ears!” they howled.
“First have some lemonade,” invited the rabbit.

[Illustration]

8. “What kind of lemonade have you?” barked the Fox, looking hungrily at
Uncle Wiggily’s ears. “Both kinds—Sweet and Sour,” replied the bunny.
“Then I’ll take both kind—mixed!” chuckled the Fox, trying to be funny.
“One kind will be enough for you, and it doesn’t make any difference what
kind!” cried Uncle Wiggily, and he threw the whole pail full of Sour
lemonade over the bad Fox.

[Illustration]

9. “Oh, wow! What does this mean?” barked the Fox. “It means that I am
tired of having you make fun of my lemonade!” cried the bunny. “And I’m
tired of waiting for your ears!” howled the Wolf, as the Fox ran away.
“It’s time you made a home-run also, Mr. Wolf!” chuckled the bunny. Then
he threw pail, lemonade and all at the wolf, who ran away also. Then more
lemonade was made for the children.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
