One day Uncle Wiggily Longears took Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy for an auto
ride. “I suppose a sleigh ride would be more stylish,” spoke Uncle
Wiggily, “but I have no cutter.” Nurse Jane said the auto would suit
her very well, and away they went. But soon they came to the bottom of
a steep and slippery hill. “Will the auto go up?” asked Nurse Jane.
“Oh, I guess so,” answered Uncle Wiggily, but it did not. The wheels
slipped and skidded. “Oh, dear!” cried Nurse Jane. “What shall we do?”
Uncle Wiggily also wondered.

[Illustration]

After trying two or three times to get up the ice-covered hill, and
finding his wheels kept slipping, Uncle Wiggily said: “I will try a
new plan.” “Are you going to put chains on?” asked Nurse Jane. “I have
none, or I would,” said Mr. Longears. “But I’ll try going up the hill
backwards.” So the auto was turned around and Uncle Wiggily tried it
that way. But the wheels whizzed around, and the auto stayed in the
same place—at the foot of the hill. “We shall never get anywhere at
this rate,” said Nurse Jane.

[Illustration]

“Are you pushing, Nurse Jane?” cried Uncle Wiggily, as he turned on
more gasolene. “Are you pushing?” The muskrat lady, who had gotten out
and was in back of the auto, answered: “Am I pushing? Well, I should
say I was! Aren’t we going up the hill?” Uncle Wiggily gave a look. “We
aren’t going up a bit,” he answered. With all Nurse Jane’s pushing, the
auto seemed to be slipping back instead of going ahead. “What shall
we do?” asked the muskrat lady. “I don’t know,” sadly answered Uncle
Wiggily.

[Illustration]

“What’s the matter, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Jackie. “Won’t your auto go
up the hill?” The rabbit gentleman shook his head. “We can’t get up,”
he said. “Maybe we could help,” offered Peetie. The two Bow Wow doggie
boys had come along with their sleds to coast on the hill. “Thank you
for offering, but how could you help get Uncle Wiggily’s auto up?”
asked Nurse Jane. “He could put our sleds under the front wheels,” said
Jackie, “and then he would have an auto sled. Maybe it would go up
easier then.”

[Illustration]

“It was very kind of you to offer me your sleds,” said Uncle Wiggily
to Jackie and Peetie. The sleds of the doggie boys were tied to the
two front wheels of the auto with ropes. “Now we will surely go up the
hill!” said Nurse Jane. So they all got in the machine again, and Uncle
Wiggily started off. But alas! Once more the back wheels spun around
like an alarm clock. “Oh, we shall never get up,” said Nurse Jane. “And
I am afraid something is going to happen! Suppose the Pipsisewah and
Skeezicks come along now?”

[Illustration]

“What did I tell you!” cried the Pipsisewah to the Skeezicks. “This is
our lucky day.” The Skee sort of wrinkled up his nose preposterous like
and remarked: “Lucky day? What do you mean?” The Pipsisewah, with his
paw, pointed to Uncle Wiggily, Nurse Jane and Jackie and Peetie Bow
Wow, still in the auto sled at the foot of the hill. “That is what I
mean—souse!” grunted the Pip. “There is Uncle Wiggily at the foot of a
slippery hill. He can’t get up, and we can catch him. Are you with me?”
The Skee said: “Yes!”

[Illustration]

“What seems to be the trouble, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Mr. Prickly
Porcupine Hedgehog, as he came walking along. “What’s the matter?” Mr.
Longears stopped the wheels from spinning. “The matter is this hill is
so slippery we can’t get up. Our wheels skid, even though the boys’
sleds are in front.” Mr. Hedgehog gave a sneeze. “I can help you.”
“How, if you please?” asked Nurse Jane. “I have a lot of loose, sharp
quills, like horseshoe nails,” answered Mr. Porcupine. “Fasten them to
your wheels.”

[Illustration]

“It is very lucky you came along, Mr. Hedgehog,” said Uncle Wiggily,
as, with the doggie boys to help, the rabbit gentleman tied some of the
loose, sharp quills around the rear wheels of his auto. “Yes, I am glad
I had plenty of loose quills,” spoke the porcupine gentleman. “They
will be the same as a lot of stickery spikes and your wheels won’t slip
any more. Take a few more quills, and I have another ball of cord.” But
Uncle Wiggily had enough string. “Oh, hurry!” squeaked the Squiggle
Bugs.

[Illustration]

Just as Uncle Wiggily, Jackie and Peetie finished putting the sharp,
stickery quills of Mr. Hedgehog Porcupine on the auto wheels, along
came the Pipsisewah and Skeezicks. “We want souse!” they cried. But the
rabbit gentleman and his friends jumped into the auto sled, and away
they went. The wheels did not skim around because the stickery quills
caught on the ice, and they sent up a shower of frozen splinters into
the faces of the two bad chaps. “Hurray! now we are safe!” cried the
jolly Squiggle Bugs, and all was well.

    And if the Parrot doesn’t go fishing with the lollypop
        stick, and catch the Canary Bird when it’s
       playing tag with the loaf of bread, the next
            pictures and story will tell how

[Illustration]

Uncle Wiggily Made a Pudding, and the Skeezicks Came Around. But He Was
Quite Surprised to Find the Nutmegs Were Unground.

[Illustration]

“What are you going to do when you finish shoveling that path, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper.
“Oh, nothing special,” answered the bunny rabbit. “Then perhaps you
will take this pail of rice pudding over to Mr. Twistytail, the pig
gentleman?” asked Nurse Jane. “He isn’t feeling very well, and maybe
some rice pudding will do him good.” “I’ll take it over as soon as I
finish cleaning off the snow,” said the rabbit gentleman.

[Illustration]

“Well, where are you going, Floppy and Curly?” asked Uncle Wiggily, as
he met the two piggie boys with their snow plow when he was on his way
to take Nurse Jane’s rice pudding to Mr. Twistytail. “Oh, we were just
making a path to your bungalow,” answered Floppy. “Well, I am going to
your house, to take your father some rice pudding, because he is ill,”
said the rabbit gentleman. “Good!” grunted Floppy and Curly. “We’ll
ride you there on our snow plow.”

[Illustration]

Curly and Floppy gave Uncle Wiggily a nice ride to their pen-house.
When the rabbit gentleman saw Mr. Twistytail sitting near the fire,
wrapped in a bed quilt, and with his feet in a tub of hot water, Mr.
Longears was very sorry for his friend. “Eat some of Nurse Jane’s rice
pudding. That will make you feel better.” Mr. Twistytail gave Floppy
and Curly each a taste of the pudding. “Oh, I wish there was a whole
lot of it!” grunted Curly! and Floppy said the same thing. “I’ll make a
pudding,” promised Uncle Wiggily.

[Illustration]

“Oh, will you really make us a pudding?” asked Floppy. “I’ll make you
a snow pudding. Just ask your mother to let me take some eggs, sugar,
molasses, nutmeg and a few things like that. Then I’ll easily make a
snow pudding.” Curly and Floppy clapped their feet in delight. “But
our mother isn’t home,” said Floppy. She went to the store for some
medicine for Daddy’s cold. Mr. Longears said Mrs. Twistytail didn’t
really need to be home. “We’ll go to the kitchen and make the pudding
ourselves,” he added.

[Illustration]

“Let me see now,” said Uncle Wiggily, as the pudding was almost
finished. “I have put in the sugar, milk, eggs and cocoanut. And you
put in the snow, to make it like ice cream, didn’t you, Curly, my boy?”
The little piggie chap said he had put in plenty of snow. “And now I
have forgotten how to put in the nutmegs to make the pudding spicy. I
forget whether you put them in whole like hickorynuts, or grate them up
fine, like powder. I really have forgotten. I guess I’ll put them in
whole.”

[Illustration]

At last the snow pudding was finished. Uncle Wiggily dropped into it
the box full of whole, hard, round nutmegs. “They ought to give it a
fine flavor—just like lemonade,” said the rabbit gentleman, as he set
the pudding out in the snow of the back porch to cool and freeze, like
ice cream. Curly and Floppy were sure they would. “We’ll give daddy
some of the nice snow pudding when he wakes up,” said Floppy. “And
we’ll save some to give mother when she comes home,” spoke Curly.

[Illustration]

“Hello! What have we here?” asked the Pipsisewah, as he and the
Skeezicks jumped over the snow drift and sneaked up to the piggie boys’
house. The Skeezicks gave a grunt: “I was just wondering that myself.
I saw Uncle Wiggily set it out. It must be something good.” They took
a sniff and the Pip cried: “It’s a pudding! Hurray! Lucky I have this
long-handled spoon! I’ll dip it in and we’ll take turns eating this
pudding. If we can’t get Uncle Wiggily’s souse we’ll have his pudding.
Come on!”

[Illustration]

“Here you are, my friend,” said the Pipsisewah, as he dipped up a
large spoonful of the snow pudding, and held it out toward the skinny
Skeezicks. “Have a big bite.” The Skeezicks saw something dropping from
the spoon the Pip had just used. “What are those things?” asked the
Skee. “Oh, just large, fat juicy raisins, I guess,” the Pip answered.
“Take a hard bite now, and I’ll do the same.” As the Pip and Skee were
eating the pudding Uncle Wiggily opened the door and saw them. He and
the boys were surprised.

[Illustration]

“Ha! Ha!” laughed Uncle Wiggily as he saw the Pip and Skee run away.
“Ho! Ho! That’s the time I fooled them!” They saw the bad chaps running
away, holding their jaws. “They bit too hard on the nutmegs in our
pudding,” said the bunny rabbit. “I remember, now, I should have grated
the nutmeg. It’s just as well I didn’t, or else the Pip and the Skee
would have eaten it all. I can pick out the whole nutmegs, grate one,
and our pudding will be as good as ever.” And it was.

    Now if the lemonade doesn’t slip on the butter knife, and
        fall downstairs when the teacup is trying to dance
             in the sugar bowl, the next pictures and
                      story will tell how

[Illustration]

The Bad Pip, Skee and Fox Chased Uncle Wiggily and the Bunny Thought
Surely He Would Be Caught. But the Snow Fort Saved Him.

[Illustration]

Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit gentleman, was out walking
in the snow-covered fields one day, when he met Sammie and Susie
Littletail, the two rabbit children, and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail,
the two squirrel brothers. “Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?” asked
Susie. “Oh, just to look for an adventure,” replied Mr. Longears.
“Don’t you want to come?” They started, Uncle Wiggily holding Susie’s
paw, the boys throwing snowballs. “I’d like to see the bad Pipsisewah
or Skeezicks now!” said Billie.

[Illustration]

“Why do you want to see the Pipsisewah or Skeezicks, Billie?” asked
Johnnie, the other squirrel boy. “Oh, so I could throw snowballs at
’em!” answered Billie, “and pay them back for trying to get Uncle
Wiggily’s souse.” The bunny rabbit made some holes in the snow with
his red, white and blue-striped rheumatism crutch, and then, all of a
sudden, Susie cried: “Well, you have you wish, Billie Bushytail! Look,
there’s the Skeezicks now, and the Pipsisewah and bad fox are with him!
Oh! Oh! What shall we do?”

[Illustration]

When Uncle Wiggily saw the bad Pipsisewah, the Skeezicks and the fuzzy
fox, the rabbit gentleman said: “Come on! We must run as fast as we can
to get away from these creatures!” And Uncle Wiggily ran, pulling Susie
along by her paw. Johnnie and Billie scampered along. “Take your white
handkerchief off that stick, Sammie!” called Billie to the rabbit boy.
“Else they’ll think we have surrendered, and we haven’t—we’re going to
fight ’em! Take down the white flag!”

[Illustration]

“Run along, children, run along!” cried Uncle Wiggily. Sammie and
Susie and Johnnie and Billie ran over the hard, cold water of a frozen
brook. “What are you going to do, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Susie, when the
little rabbit girl was safe on the other side of the brook. “I’m going
to make a hole in the ice so the Pip, the Skee and the fox can’t cross
and get us, I hope.” With his crutch he made a hole in the ice. But the
Pip, Skee and fox had not given up the chase. On they came, faster and
faster.

[Illustration]

After Uncle Wiggily had chopped a hole in the ice with his crutch, he
ran on with the animal children. But Susie, looking back, cried: “Oh,
Uncle Wiggily! See what they’re doing!” And, surely enough, the bad
chaps had pulled some boards off a fence, and, making a bridge of them,
they crossed the hole in the ice and still kept on after Uncle Wiggily
and the animal children. “We must have our souse to-day,” said the Pip;
also the Skee, and the funny fox joined in the chorus.

[Illustration]

“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Susie, after she had run on a little
farther, after the Pip, Skee and fox had crossed the ice on the fence
boards. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily, I can’t go another step!” “I’ll carry you!”
said the brave rabbit gentleman. “We won’t leave you behind, Susie, for
the bad Pipsisewah!” Susie cuddled down in Uncle Wiggily’s warm, fur
coat. Billie threw a snowball at the bad chaps. All of a sudden Sammie
cried: “Oh, if we can reach the old snow fort we made last week, maybe
we will be saved!”

[Illustration]

Running fast, Uncle Wiggily and his little animal friends reached the
old snow fort before the Pip, Skee and fox could catch them. But the
bad chaps still came on. “Quick, now!” cried Uncle Wiggily, “we must
get ready to snowball the bad chaps!” Susie made herself a little red
cross from a piece of Johnnie’s red neckerchief, and Sammie gave his
sister his white handkerchief to tear up into bandages in case any of
them should be hurt in the battle soon to take place. “We want souse!”
howled the Pip.

[Illustration]

“Come on now!” cried the Pip to the Skee and fox. “We must charge on
them in the fort! We must capture Uncle Wiggily!” The Skee and fox ran
up the hill with the Pip. “Ouch! Wouch!” cried the Skee. “Some one
hit me in the eye with a snowball!” Uncle Wiggily had made a lot of
snowballs for the animal boys to throw at the enemy. “Bang away! Bang
away!” cried brave Uncle Wiggily. “Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!” shouted the
boys, while Red Cross Nurse Susie was all ready with rolls of bandages.

[Illustration]

The boys throw so many hard snowballs over the wall of the fort at the
Pip, Skee and fox, that the bad animals were glad enough to run away.
“Oh, wow! Come on out of this!” howled the Pip to the Skee, and down
the hill they ran. “Hoist the flag! We’ve won the fight!” cried Sammie.
He made a banner from red and blue pieces of Billie’s and Johnnie’s
neckerchiefs and pieces of white from his own handkerchief. A hole was
in Uncle Wiggily’s hat, but Susie bandaged it up. The snow fort saved
Uncle Wiggily.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
