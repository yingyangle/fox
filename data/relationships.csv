Bird,"<p>Ancient texts describe the fox interacting with a number of different birds, such as the raven, eagle, bustard, crow, falcon, chicken, merlin, and aesalon. </p>
			<h5>Friends - Raven</h5>
      <p class=""quote-bubble"">""Of the <b>Raven</b> you might say that it has a spirit no less daring than the eagle, for it even attacks animals, and not the smallest either, but asses and bulls. It settles on their neck and pecks them, and in many cases it actually gouges out their eyes. And it fights with that vigorous bird the <b>merlin</b>, and whenever it sees it fighting with a fox, it <b>comes to the fox’s rescue</b>, for it is on <b>friendly terms</b> with the animal.""<sup><a class=""citation"" href=""https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL446.151.xml"" data-tooltip=""Aelian, <i>On Animals</i>"" data-source=""aelian-characteristics"" target=""_blank""></a></sup></p>

			<h5>Enemies - Heron, Crow, Falcon, Kirkos, Merlin, Aesalon</h5>
      <p class=""quote-bubble"">""There are three kinds of <b>herons</b>, the grey, the white, and the so-called starry. Of these the grey has difficulty in being covered and in covering; for it screams and, so they say, drips blood from its eyes while covering, and it gives birth badly and painfully.

			<h5>Prey - Bustard</h5>

			<p class=""quote-bubble"">""He says therefore in the first part, that the Fox is a <b>deceitful</b> beast, which the countryman hates because he <b>steals his fowls</b>, and if food is scarce ('Thus wanting victims like these'), he naturally finds a <b>scheme</b> or <b>trick</b>, by which scheme it may be possible for him to <b>catch birds</b>.<br>Therefore he goes to a place <b>where birds are wont</b> to collect on account of carcasses, and stretches himself out <b>lying on his back</b>, as if not drawing his breath.

Wolf,"<p>The fox and the wolf are commonly described as enemies and appear together frequently in fable. One notable example of the fox interacting with the wolf appears in the Reynard Cycle, where Reynard make enemies with Isingrim the Wolf.</p>

Bear,"<p>The fox is frequently seen tricking the easily duped bear in fable. In one story, the fox tricks the <b>bear</b> into fishing by sticking his <b>tail</b> in a <b>hole in the ice</b>. The bear's tail inevitably <b>freezes</b> and he becomes stuck, and can only free himself through <b>self mutilation</b>.<sup><a class=""citation sources-citation"" data-tooltip=""Uther, 'The Fox in World Literature', pg. 142"" data-source=""uther""></a></sup> In the Reynard version of this story, the <b>bear's wife</b> is the one who is tricked, and <b>Reynard</b> then proceeds to <b>force himself on her</b> while she's stuck, thus adding an additional layer of <b>selfishness</b> and <b>depravity</b> to his deceptive actions.<sup><a class=""citation sources-citation"" data-tooltip=""<i>Reynard the Fox</i>"" data-source=""reynard""></a></sup> In another story, the fox tells the bear he'll give him a beauty treatment and convinces him to climb into a hayloft, upon which the fox sets the building on fire and singes the bear's fur.<sup><a class=""citation sources-citation"" data-tooltip=""Uther, 'The Fox in World Literature', pg. 142"" data-source=""uther""></a></sup></p>"
Hare,"<p>Foxes are hares primarily have a predator-prey relationship, as the fox hunts the hare for food. Since the hare is swift-footed and faster than the fox, the fox catches it by chasing it continuously during the night and tiring it out until it gives up.</p>
			<p class=""quote-bubble""><b>Hares</b> are <b>caught by Foxes</b> more often than not through an artifice, for the Fox is a <b>master of trickery</b> and knows many a ruse. For instance, when <b>by night</b> it comes upon the track of a Hare and has scented the animal, it steals upon it softly and with <b>noiseless tread</b>, and holds its breath, and finding it in its form, attempts to seize it, supposing it to be free of fear and anxiety. But the Hare is not a luxurious creature and <b>does not sleep carefree</b>, but directly it is aware of the Fox’s approach it <b>leaps from its bed</b> and is off. And it speeds on its way with all haste: but the Fox <b>follows in its track</b> and continues its pursuit. And the Hare after covering a great distance, <b>under the impression that it has won</b> and is not likely to be caught, plunges into a thicket and is glad to rest. But the Fox is after it and will not allow it to remain still, but <b>once again rouses it</b> and stimulates it to run again. Then a second course no shorter than the first is gone through, and the Hare again <b>longs to rest</b>, but the Fox is upon it and by shaking the thicket contrives to keep it from sleeping. And again it darts out, but the Fox is hard after it. But when it is driven into running course after course without intermission, and <b>want of sleep ensues</b>, the <b>Hare gives up</b> and the Fox overtakes it and seizes it, having caught it not indeed by speed but <b>by length of time and by craft</b>.<sup><a class=""citation"" href=""https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL449.95.xml"" data-tooltip=""Aelian, <i>On Animals</i>"" data-source=""aelian-characteristics"" target=""_blank""></a></sup></p>

Hedgehog,"<p>Foxes are noted to catch the prickly hedgehod using a number of clever tricks.</p>
			<p class=""quote-bubble"">""The <b>Fox</b> is a <b>rascally creature</b>, hence poets are fond of calling it ‘<b>crafty</b>.’ The <b>Hedgehog</b> also is a <b>rascal</b>, for directly it sees the Fox approaching it <b>rolls itself into a ball</b> and lies still.

			<p class=""quote-bubble"">The <b>Fox</b> is a <b>crafty creature</b>. For instance, it plots against Hedgehogs in the following way.

Wasp,"<p>Foxes are observed to have a clever way of stealing honey from wasps. They use their tail to trap the wasps and kill them, and once they've killed all the wasps they reach into the comb to lick up all the honey.</p>
