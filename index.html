			<h3>Traits and Behaviors</h3>

			<p>Let's first take a look at how foxes are described in terms of their physical and behavioral characteristics by ancient natural philosophers such as <b>Aristotle</b>, <b>Aelian</b>, and <b>Pliny the Elder</b>. Aristotle observes that foxes are born <b>blind</b><sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-generation_animals/1942/pb_LCL366.211.xml" data-tooltip="Aristotle, <i>Generation of Animals</i>" data-source="aristotle-gen" target="_blank"></a></sup> and in an "<b>unfinished state</b>", and the mother <b>licks their young</b> in order to warm them up and shape them to completion.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL353.405.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a>, <a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.343.xml" data-tooltip="Aristotle, <i>Generation of Animals</i>" data-source="aristotle-gen" target="_blank"></a></sup></sup></p>

			<p>The fox is also observed to run along <b>the side of the pathway</b> rather than on the path directly.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 73" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup> This is perhaps related to the ancient <b>folk etymology</b> for the Latin word <i><b>vulpēs</b></i> meaning "fox", which is proposed to come from <i><b>volvō</b></i> ("to roll") and <i><b>pēs</b></i> ("foot") because foxes don't travel in a <b>straight or direct path</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 77" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup> We also see descriptions of how the fox <b>bites off his own foot</b> to escape from traps. For this behavior, <b>Theobaldus</b> gives a rare notes of <b>praise</b> to the otherwise heavily condemned fox, referencing a line from the <b>Gospel</b>, 'If thy hand or foot offend thee, cast it from thee, for it is <b>better with one hand</b> or foot to enter into the <b>kingdom of heaven</b>, than with two hands or feet to go into hell.'<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 73-74" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<p>The fox is known throughout many texts for its ability to hunt prey in clever way. Foxes are seen hunting hares, fish, and a variety of birds. The <b>Laconian hounds</b> which were used for hunting are also said to have been born from foxes and dogs<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL439.205.xml" data-tooltip="Aristotle, <i>Generation of Animals</i>" data-source="aristotle-gen" target="_blank"></a></sup> In <b>Thrace</b> and other "frostbound countries", foxes are also known for their "<b>formidable sagacity</b>" and people watch them to determine <b>whether the ice on a frozen river is strong enough to cross</b>.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL353.75.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<div class="quote fancy-border">
				"The people of <b>Thrace</b> use this animal as an indicator of <b>whether a frozen river is safe to cross</b>. And if the Fox runs across without the ice bending or giving way beneath its tread, they make bold to follow. The Fox tests the safety of the transit in the following manner: it <b>puts its ear down to the ice</b>, and if it <b>hears no sound of the flow beneath</b> and no murmur in the depths, it has no fear, the ice being solid, and it races over without hesitation. Otherwise it would not set foot upon it." <br><a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL448.43.xml" target="_blank">Aelian, <i>On Animals</i> 6.24</a>
			</div>

			<p>Foxes were also hunted by humans for their <b>fur</b> and to prevent them from <b>stealing chickens</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup> They were most commonly hunted using <b>dogs</b>, although <b>Oppian</b> warns that foxes still put up quite a fight and inflicted wounded the hounds.</p>

			<div class="quote fancy-border">
				"The Fox is <b>not to be captured by ambush</b> nor by noose nor by net. For she is <b>clever in her cunning</b> at perceiving them; clever too at severing a rope and loosing knots and by subtle craft escaping from death.

			</div>

			<p><b>Aelian</b> also describes <b>hunting practices</b> in <b>India</b>, where they train <b>birds</b> to hunt foxes for them. They first take a domesticated fox and <b>attach pieces of meat</b> to them. Then, they let the foxes loose and the <b>birds fly after them</b>, drawn by the meat. This way, the birds are trained to hunt down foxes and bring them back to their owners.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL446.239.xml" data-tooltip="Aelian, <i>On Animals</i>" data-source="aelian-characteristics" target="_blank"></a></sup> </p>

			<p><b>Fox fur</b> is particularly common in <b>Thrace</b>, where the soldiers wore <i><b>alopekis</b></i> hats made of fox fur and the women wore <i><b>bassara</b></i> costumes made of fox fur during celebrations of <b>Dionysus</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup></p>

			<p>Foxes were also given as <b>love gifts</b> between <b>male homosexual lovers</b> in <b>Athens</b>, typically given by the <i><b>erastes</b></i> (the older man) to the <i><b>eromenos</b></i> (the younger man). Smaller foxes such as <b>fennec foxes</b> which are found in <b>North Africa</b> were sometimes kept as <b>pets</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 70-71" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup></p>

			<p>Foxes are also noted to have <b>medicinal uses</b> in the classical world. <b>Sores</b> can be treated by <b>fox fat</b><sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.115.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup>, and <b>gout</b> is said to be remedied by a fox "<b>boiled down alive</b> until only the bones remain".<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.149.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup> A supposed way of <b>protecting chickens</b> from foxes was to feed the chickens <b>dried fox liver</b> or put some <b>fox skin</b> around their necks, in which case the foxes wouldn't touch them.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.179.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<!-- RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ANIMALS -->

			<h3>Relationships with Other Animals</h3>

			<p>The fox is also observed to interact with other terrestrial animals, often in a negative or inimical manner. These interactions can also be seen in Aesop's fables, where the fox is typically shown tricking others and taking advantage of them. Let's take a look at which animals the fox most often interacts with in the Aesopian fables.</p>
