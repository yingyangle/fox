			<p>Foxes are <b>mammals</b> which are <b>adaptive</b> and can live in a number of <b>different environments</b>. They occasionally interact with humans and are <b>appreciated</b> for their ability to get rid of <b>rodents and pests</b>, but are also <b>troublesome</b> for their tendency to <b>steal fowl</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 70" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup> In our <b>culture</b>, we often assign many <b>anthropomorphic traits</b> and characteristics to different animals, and especially the fox. What are the first <b>adjectives</b> or <b>verbs</b> you think of <b>when you think of foxes</b>? Let's take a look at what other people answered.</p>

			<p>We can see that foxes are typically thought of as <b>cunning</b> and <b>sly</b> animals who often <b>hunt</b>, <b>steal</b>, and <b>sneak</b> around. But where do these associations come from? Let's take a look at how the fox is described in <b>literature</b>. Here we can see the <b>most common adjectives</b> used to describe foxes in books available for free from <b>Project Gutenberg</b>.</p>

			<div class="viz" id="adj"></div>

			<p>As we can see, <b>books</b> tend to describe foxes using more <b>physical traits</b> than character traits, with many <b>color words</b> such as "red", "gray", "black", and "white" appearing quite frequently. The <b>character traits</b> they do utilize generally match the ideas we saw the in the survey responses above, focusing on the fox's <b>intelligence</b> and <b>cunning</b> with words like "smart", "sly", "wise", and "cunning". It seems that our common connotations of the fox are <b>reflected in our literature</b> and these character traits persist <b>throughout many centures</b>. In this essay we'll explore a number of different <b>themes and motifs</b> of the fox in the <b>classical</b> and <b>pre-modern</b> world, and how these ideas might have developed.</p>

			<!-- TRAITS AND BEHAVIORS -->
			<h3 id="traits">Traits and Behaviors</h3>
			<img src="media/fox_traits.svg" alt="" width="160px">

			<p>Let's first take a look at how foxes are described in terms of their physical and behavioral characteristics by ancient natural philosophers such as <b>Aristotle</b>, <b>Aelian</b>, and <b>Pliny the Elder</b>. Aristotle observes that foxes are born <b>blind</b><sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-generation_animals/1942/pb_LCL366.211.xml" data-tooltip="Aristotle, <i>Generation of Animals</i>" data-source="aristotle-gen" target="_blank"></a></sup> and in an "<b>unfinished state</b>", and the mother <b>licks their young</b> in order to warm them up and shape them to completion.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL353.405.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a>, <a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.343.xml" data-tooltip="Aristotle, <i>Generation of Animals</i>" data-source="aristotle-gen" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<p>The fox is also observed to run along <b>the side of the pathway</b> rather than on the path directly.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 73" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup> This is perhaps related to the ancient <b>folk etymology</b> for the Latin word <i><b>vulpēs</b></i> meaning "fox", which is proposed to come from <i><b>volvō</b></i> ("to roll") and <i><b>pēs</b></i> ("foot") because foxes don't travel in a <b>straight or direct path</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 77" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<p>The fox is known throughout many texts for its ability to <b>hunt prey</b> in clever way. Foxes are seen hunting hares, fish, and a variety of birds. The <b>Laconian hounds</b> which were used for hunting are also said to have been born from <b>foxes and dogs</b>.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL439.205.xml" data-tooltip="Aristotle, <i>Generation of Animals</i>" data-source="aristotle-gen" target="_blank"></a></sup> In <b>Thrace</b> and other "frostbound countries", foxes are also known for their "<b>formidable sagacity</b>" and people watch them to determine <b>whether the ice on a frozen river is strong enough to cross</b>.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL353.75.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<div class="quote fancy-border">
				"The people of <b>Thrace</b> use this animal as an indicator of <b>whether a frozen river is safe to cross</b>. And if the Fox runs across without the ice bending or giving way beneath its tread, they make bold to follow. The Fox tests the safety of the transit in the following manner: it <b>puts its ear down to the ice</b>, and if it <b>hears no sound of the flow beneath</b> and no murmur in the depths, it has no fear, the ice being solid, and it races over without hesitation. Otherwise it would not set foot upon it." <br><a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL448.43.xml" target="_blank">Aelian, <i>On Animals</i> 6.24</a>
			</div>

			<p>Foxes were also hunted by humans for their warm <b>fur</b> and to prevent them from <b>stealing chickens</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 70" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup> They were known to be <b>difficult to catch</b> using <b>traps</b>, and when they were caught they were known to <b>bite off their own leg</b> in order to escape.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 73-74" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup> Because of this, foxes were most commonly hunted using <b>dogs</b>, although <b>Oppian</b> warns that foxes still <b>put up quite a fight</b> and inflict wounds upon the hounds.</p>

			<div class="quote fancy-border">
				"The Fox is <b>not to be captured by ambush</b> nor by noose nor by net. For she is <b>clever in her cunning</b> at perceiving them; clever too at severing a rope and loosing knots and by subtle craft escaping from death. But the thronging <b>hounds</b> take her; yet even they for all their strength <b>do not overcome her without bloodshed</b>." <br><a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/oppian-cynegetica_chase/1928/pb_LCL219.151.xml" target="_blank">Oppian, <i>Cynegetica</i> 3.449-460</a>
			</div>

			<p><b>Aelian</b> also describes <b>hunting practices</b> in <b>India</b>, where they train <b>birds</b> to hunt foxes for them. They first take a domesticated fox and <b>attach pieces of meat</b> to them. Then, they let the foxes loose and the <b>birds fly after them</b>, drawn by the meat. This way, the birds are trained to hunt down foxes and bring them back to their owners.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL446.239.xml" data-tooltip="Aelian, <i>On Animals</i>" data-source="aelian-characteristics" target="_blank"></a></sup> </p>

			<p><b>Fox fur</b> wasn't used very widely outside of <b>Thrace</b>, which was known for its distinctive use of fox fur.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="<i>The Culture of Animals in Antiquity</i>, pg. 362" data-source="animals-antiquity" target="_blank"></a></sup> In Thrace, the soldiers wore <i><b>alopekis</b></i> hats made of fox fur and the women wore fox fur <i><b>bassara</b></i> costumes during celebrations of <b>Dionysus</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 70-71" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup></p>

			<p>Foxes were also given as <b>love gifts</b> between <b>male homosexual lovers</b> in <b>Athens</b>, typically given by the <i><b>erastes</b></i> (the older man) to the <i><b>eromenos</b></i> (the younger man). Smaller foxes such as <b>fennec foxes</b> which are found in <b>North Africa</b> were sometimes kept as <b>pets</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 70-71" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup></p>

			<p>Foxes are also noted to have <b>medicinal uses</b> in the classical world. <b>Sores</b> can be treated by <b>fox fat</b><sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.115.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup>, and <b>gout</b> is said to be remedied by a fox "<b>boiled down alive</b> until only the bones remain".<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.149.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup> A supposed way of <b>protecting chickens</b> from foxes was to feed the chickens <b>dried fox liver</b> or put some <b>fox skin</b> around their necks, in which case the foxes wouldn't touch them.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.179.xml" data-tooltip="Pliny the Elder, <i>Natural History</i>" data-source="pliny-natural" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<!-- RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ANIMALS -->
			<h3 id="relationships">Relationships with Other Animals</h3>
			<img src="media/fox_relationships.svg" alt="" width="160px">

			<p>Classical writers also make many observations of how the fox <b>interacts with others</b> in the animal world, and especially make note of how it tricks its <b>predators and prey</b>. These kinds of relationships can also be seen reflected in <b>fable</b>, as the fox, who is almost always <b>female</b>, interacts with others typically in a negative or inimical manner. We can especially see this in <b>Aesop's fables</b>, where the fox is typically shown <b>tricking other animals</b> and <b>taking advantage</b> of them and the situation. Let's take a look at which animals the fox is seen interacting with <b>most frequently</b> in Aesops' fables.</p>

			<div class="bubble-text"><b>Hover over the links</b> of the diagram below to see how many fables feature a given pair of animals.</div>

			<p>As we can see, the fox appears most frequently in Aesopian fables with the <b>lion</b> and the <b>wolf</b>, and doesn't appear in any stories with the <b>bird</b>, <b>snake</b>, or <b>sheep</b>. The <b>fox and lion</b> as a pair seems to be especially prevalent, as both are seen interacting with each other the most. These trends however don't seem to be reflected in <b>classical observations</b> of foxes, as the fox naturally <b>does not encounter</b> lions and wolves as frequently as it does <b>animals of prey</b> such as birds or hares. Now let's see how ancient writers describe <b>foxes' relationships with other animals</b> outside of fable.</p>

			<!-- COMMON MOTIFS -->
			<h3 id="motifs">Motifs and Imagery</h3>
			<img src="media/fox_motifs.svg" alt="" width="160px">

			<p>From these descriptions, we can begin to get a picture of some of the <b>character traits</b> associated with the fox through its <b>behavior</b>. The fox is described as "<b>mischeivous</b>", "<b>wicked</b>", and "<b>full of guile</b>", and this idea of the fox as a trickster interestingly persists throughout many depictions of the fox in <b>different cultures</b>. In addition to the association with trickery, the fox is also frequently linked to <b>damage and destruction</b>. We see foxes bring about damage through <b>spreading fire</b>, <b>pillaging vineyards</b>, and <b>seducing or possessing humans</b> through <b>magical abilities</b>. In a similar strain, we also see the negative connotation of the fox develop into a connection to the <b>devil</b> in the <b>Christian tradition</b>.</p>

			<p>Before we explore these themes in detail, let's take a quick look at some of the interesting stories about foxes we find around the world. </p>

									<p>The Teumessian Fox was sent to ravage the landscape of Thebes and it was fated to never be caught. It was sent either by Dionysus as a punishment for failing to recognize him as a divinity, or as a punishment for the death of the Sphinx. When King Creon ordered Amphitryon to deal with the fox, he sent the dog Laelaps to catch it since this dog was fated to catch everything it ever caught. In order to resolve this paradox, Zeus either turned them both to stone or sent them to the stars.</p><p>The swiftness of the Teumessian Fox and its characteristic of being uncatchable seems to reflect many of the ideas of the fox as a swift-footed and elusive creature, always managing to slip out of traps and escape. We also see the association between foxes and causing damage here, as the Teumessian Fox brought damage to the land of Thebes, just as Samson's foxes brought damage to the Philistines and the burning box set fire to the fields of Cerealia.</p>

			<!-- TRICKERY & INTELLIGENCE -->
			<h3 id="trickery">Trickery & Cleverness</h3>
			<img src="media/clever.svg" alt="fire" width="160px">

			<p>Of the many traits associated with the fox, the most common by far is its ability and tendency for <b>clever</b> and <b>cunning tricks</b>. As we saw in the fox's interactions with other animals, classical writers often observed the fox using <b>clever tricks</b> to <b>hunt prey</b>, which perhaps explains in part the <b>prevalence</b> of the <b>cunning fox</b> character. The fox plays dead to hunt <b>birds</b>, kills the <b>hedgehog</b> through suffocation, hunts <b>hares</b> by running them to exhaustion, steals <b>honey</b> from <b>wasps</b>, and catches <b>fish</b> an almost <b>human-like</b> way by using its tail as a fishing rod. They are also known for their intelligence, as the <b>Thracians</b> observe their ability to tell <b>whether the ice is safe</b> to cross by listening to the currents.</p>

			<p>We see much of this intelligence and trickery reflected in fable and folklore, as the fox is often shown <b>deceiving other animals</b>, and always seems to be able to <b>escape from traps</b> or unfavorable situations. One of the most well-known foxes from literature, <b>Reynard</b>, embodies many of these <b>cunning</b> and <b>selfish</b> qualities which we see reflected in <b>Aesop's fables</b> and other European folk stories.</p>

			<p>Here's a look at how classical writers describe the fox's cunning and crafty nature.</p>

			<!-- QUOTES LIST -->

				</div>
			</div>

			<h5>- Europe -</h5>

			<p>In European folklore, the fox is most often seen tricking the <b>bear</b> and the <b>wolf</b>. In one story, the fox tricks the <b>bear</b> into fishing by sticking his <b>tail</b> in a <b>hole in the ice</b>. The bear's tail inevitably <b>freezes</b> and he becomes stuck, and can only free himself through <b>self mutilation</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Uther, 'The Fox in World Literature', pg. 142" data-source="uther"></a></sup> In the Reynard version of this story, the <b>bear's wife</b> is the one who is tricked, and <b>Reynard</b> then proceeds to <b>force himself on her</b> while she's stuck, thus adding an additional layer of <b>selfishness</b> and <b>depravity</b> to his deceptive actions.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="<i>Reynard the Fox</i>" data-source="reynard"></a></sup> In another story, the fox tells the bear he'll give him a beauty treatment and convinces him to climb into a hayloft, upon which the fox sets the building on fire and singes the bear's fur.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Uther, 'The Fox in World Literature', pg. 142" data-source="uther"></a></sup></p>

			<p>In addition to causing <b>harm and injury</b> just for fun, the fox also uses its cleverness for its own <b>self-gain</b>. We often see the fox taking more <b>food</b> for itself when <b>dividing prey</b> with other animals or participating in a <b>collaborative hunt</b>. The fox also tricks other animals into <b>helping it escape</b> from traps, sometimes at the expense of the animal who helps them.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Uther, 'The Fox in World Literature', pg. 142" data-source="uther"></a></sup></p>

			<h5>- Japan -</h5>

			<p>We also see Japanese stories of <b>fox possession</b> which usually involve a human being <b>deceived or fooled</b> while pursuing <b>carnal desires</b>. In one story, a man is tricked into eating <b>rice cakes</b> which are actually <b>horse droppings</b>, and in another story a villager is tricked into taking a <b>hot bath</b> in what is actually a <b>cold river</b>. In Japan we also see the concept of a <i><b>kitsune no yomeiri</b></i> ("fox-bride's wedding"), which is a colloquial saying expressing a "<b>sudden rainfall</b>". This phrase also has connotations of feeling <b>deceived</b> to be suddenly caught in unexpected rainfall, connecting to the strong association between foxes and trickery.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Miyamoto, 'Fire and Femininity', pg. 80-83" data-source="miyamoto"></a></sup></p>

			<br><br>
			<!-- FIRE -->
			<h3 id="fire">Fire</h3>
			<img src="media/fire4.svg" alt="fire" width="160px">

			<p>The fox is also often associated with <b>fire</b>, perhaps in part due to the <b>bright color</b> of its pelt and the <b>shape of its tail</b> which resembles a flame. We see many stories of a burning fox <b>bringing about damage</b> to the land. Some scholars suggest that in these stories the fox functions as a <b><i>Korndämon</i></b>, a <b>corn demon</b> from German folklore tied to the <b>fertility</b> of the crops.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Uther, <i>The Fox in World Literature</i>, pg.138" data-source="uther" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<h5>- Ritual at Cerealia -</h5>

			<p>In ancient <b>Rome</b>, foxes were bound and <b>burned alive</b> during the <b>Cerealia</b> festival which celebrated <b>Ceres</b>, the Roman goddess of <b>agriculture</b>. This tradition was said come from a boy from <b>Carseoli</b> who once tied up a fox and set it on fire. When the fox escaped, it <b>ran through the fields</b> and set them aflame, and so now the fox is set on fire during Cerealia as a <b>punishment</b> for its past crimes.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-fasti/1931/pb_LCL253.241.xml" data-tooltip="Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>" data-source="ovid-fasti" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<h5>- Samson and the 300 Foxes -</h5>

			<p>In the book of <b>Judges</b> in the Hebrew Bible, we see another story involving foxes and fire in which <b>Samson</b> gathers together <b>300 foxes</b> and <b>ties them together</b> into one big knot. He then uses torches to <b>set them on fire</b> and lets them loose in the fields of the <b>Philistines</b>, so that the foxes end up causing <b>great damage</b> to their granaries, vineyards, and olive groves.</p>

			<div class="quote fancy-border">

			<h5>- Finnish Firefox -</h5>

			<p>While these stories are typically linked to damage and destruction, in <b>Finnish</b> culture we see a different depiction of foxes and fire. Today we might recognize Firefox as the popular web browser, but in Finnish mythology the <b>firefox</b> is a creature whose <b>tail sparkles with fire</b> and creates the <b>aurora borealis</b> as it runs across the night sky.</p>

			<h5>- Kitsunebi -</h5>

			<p>We also see associations between foxes and fire in <b>East Asian</b> traditions. The <i><b>kitsunebi</b></i> (literally "foxfire") are mysterious <b>balls of fire</b> or light in <b>Japanese</b> culture, and were thought to evoke images of a <b>fox-bride's wedding</b>, as they resembled the <b>lanterns</b> typically used in marriage ceremonies. Foxes are also thought to have the ability to <b>predict fires</b>, as well as <b>start fires</b> or <b>protect houses</b> against fires, and people would give <b>offerings</b> to the fox in order to protect their homes from fire.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Miyamoto, 'Fire and Femininity', pg. 83-85" data-source="miyamoto"></a></sup></p>

			<h3 id="sin">Devil & Sin</h3>
			<img src="media/devil.svg" alt="devil" width="160px">

			<p>Following the <b>negative</b> connotations from the fox's association with fire and nasty tricks, the <b>Christian tradition</b> views the fox as a demonic animal and uses it as a symbol of the <b>devil</b> because of its <b>duplicitous nature</b>.</p>

			<h5>- Physiologus -</h5>

			<p>The <b>tricks</b> of the fox are likened to the <b>false temptations</b> of the devil. Just as the fox <b>lures birds</b> to its gaping jaws by <b>playing dead</b>, the devil similarly utilizes lies to <b>lead humans to death</b>, in the sense that he led <b>Adam and Eve</b> to transgress against God.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 75" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup> In some accounts, the <b>devil</b> is described to appear <b>in the form of a fox</b>. The saint <b>Hilarion</b> ecounters the devil in a number of forms, including the form of a fox. The devil also appears as a fox to the Irish bishop <b>Dunstan</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Uther, <i>The Fox in World Literature</i>, pg. 139" data-source="uther" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

				Whose is the flesh that he eats, if a man is devoted to vain things,<br>
				These then to man are <b>his sins</b>, things of all kinds that are vain,<br>

			<p>The fox is also compared to <b>deceitful men</b> who put up a false front and <b>talk about others</b> behind their backs. In particular, the fox is described as a double of <b>Herod</b>, who <b>pretended to want to worship Jesus</b> but secretly hated him still. This lying nature of the fox is then used as a means to teach about the <b>sins</b> of <b>envy</b>, <b>pride</b>, and <b>leisure</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 75-76" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<p>In one rare instance however the fox's behavior is <b>praised</b> rather than condemned for its sin. <b>Theobaldus</b> commends the fox for its behavior in <b>biting off its own leg</b> when ensnared in a <b>trap</b>, referencing a line from the <b>Gospel</b>, 'If thy hand or foot offend thee, cast it from thee, for it is <b>better with one hand</b> or foot to enter into the <b>kingdom of heaven</b>, than with two hands or feet to go into hell.'<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 73-74" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<img src="media/grapes.svg" alt="fire" width="160px">

			<p>One of the most famous <b>Aesopian fables</b> is the story of the <b>Fox and the Sour Grapes</b>, which follows in the long tradition of associating foxes with <b>grapes and vineyards</b>. Classical writers in <b>Greece</b>, <b>Egypt</b>, and <b>Mesopotamia</b> often observed the <b>fox eating grapes</b>. While today they may be primarily known for stealing <b>chickens</b>, in the classical world they were mostly seen as a pest to the <b>vineyard</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="<i>The Culture of Animals in Antiquity</i>, pg. 362" data-source="animals-antiquity" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<p>Foxes were observed to eat <b>grapes</b> from the vineyards during the <b>warmer months</b>, and then when <b>winter</b> comes around and the vines are bare they <b>hunt small animals</b> instead.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/oppian-cynegetica_chase/1928/pb_LCL219.151.xml" data-tooltip="Oppian, <i>Cynegetica</i>" data-source="oppian-cyn" target="_blank"></a></sup> This behavior contributed to the <b>negative</b> association of foxes with <b>damage</b> to land and agriculture, in a similar way to the damage caused by foxes and <b>fire</b>.</p>

			<h5>- Dionysus -</h5>

			<p>Because of their association with <b>vineyards</b>, we see a number of connections between the fox and <b>Dionysus</b>, god of wine and vineyards. In <b>Thrace</b> we saw <b>fox fur</b> being used for the <i><b>bassara</b></i> costumes worn by women during <b>celebrations of Dionysus</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 70-71" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup> This practice is likely connected to the cult of <b>Dionysus Bassareus</b>, a version of the Dionysus worshipped in <b>Lydia</b>. The Lydians' word for fox, <i><b>bassara</b></i>, seems to be connected to the name of this cultic deity, as well as the <i>bassara</i> costumes worn in his honor. The <b>maenads</b> or <b>Bacchae</b>, female followers who worshipped Dionysus, were similarly called <b>Bassarides</b> in Lydia.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Ridgeway, 'Bassareus', pg. 21-22" data-source="ridgeway"></a></sup></p>

			<h5>- Teumessian Fox -</h5>

			<p>One story which elaborates on the <b>damage</b> caused by foxes is the myth of the <b>Teumessian Fox</b>, who was sent by <b>Dionysus</b> to ravage the landscape of <b>Thebes</b> as punishment for failing to <b>recognize his divinity</b>. This fox was swift-footed and elusive, <b>fated never to be caught</b>. In response, <b>Amphitryon</b> send the magical dog <b>Laelaps</b> to hunt down the fox, since Laelaps was fated to <b>catch everything it ever pursued</b>. To solve the paradox, <b>Zeus</b> was said to have turned both animals to <b>stone</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kitchell, <i>Animals in the Ancient World</i>, pg. 72" data-source="kitchell"></a></sup></p>

			<br><br>
			<!-- EROTICISM -->
			<h3 id="eroticism">Eroticism & Femininity</h3>
			<img src="media/sex.svg" alt="fire" width="160px">

			<p>Another interesting facet of the fox is its common association with <b>eroticism</b> and in particular <b>feminine</b> eroticism, which we can even see in our <b>language</b> today in how we use "<b>foxy</b>" to mean a <b>sexually attractive woman</b>. These sexual connotations appear to be especially prevalent in mythical figures from <b>East Asian</b> traditions such as the <i><b>huli jing</b></i>, <i><b>kitsune</b></i>, and <i><b>kumiho</b></i>.</p>

			<h5>- Egypt -</h5>
			
			<p>In <b>Egypt</b>, we also see a connection beteween foxes and <b>sex</b>, as the word for "fox" or "<b>young fox</b>" could be used to mean a <b>lover</b> or <b>womanizer</b>, and lovers could call each other "fox" to elicit sexual connotations. In <b>Egyptian love poetry</b>, we also see the <b>fox in heat</b> used as a common image, and the <b>hieroglyph</b> <i><b>ms</b></i> meaning "birth" is composed of <b>three fox pelts</b>, and the hieroglyph appears in a number of words relating to <b>eroticism</b> and <b>fertility</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="<i>The Culture of Animals in Antiquity</i>, pg. 363" data-source="animals-antiquity" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<h5>- Fox Spirits in East Asia -</h5>

			<p>In <b>Chinese</b> folklore, the <i><b>huli jing</b></i> is a fox-spirit which can take the form of a <b>beautiful woman</b>. They generally have <b>negative</b> connotations and are known for <b>bewitching men</b>, driving them to <b>obsession</b> in order to <b>absorb their energy or essence</b>. Fox spirits are most commonly female but can also be male, and while <b>female</b> foxes absorb energy through <b>sex</b>, <b>male</b> foxes must <b>kill people</b> to absorb the energy.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Hammond, 'Vulping Alchemy', pg. 364-367" data-source="hammond"></a></sup> The <i>huli jing</i> were greatly <b>feared</b>, and sometimes <b>shaman</b> would perform tests on a <b>potential bride</b> to make sure they weren't fox-spirits in <b> disguise</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Stevens, 'Fox Spirits', pg. 153" data-source="stevens"></a></sup> Today the Chinese phrase can still be used to denote a <b>seductive woman</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Hammond, 'Vulping Alchemy', pg. 364-366" data-source="hammond"></a></sup></p>

			<p>The <i><b>kitsune</b></i> in <b>Japanese</b> folklore is analogous to the <i>huli jing</i> from Chinese folklore. The <i>kitsune</i> is also a <b>sly</b> and <b>seductive</b> fox-spirit who can transform into a <b>beautiful woman</b> and <b>enchant men</b>. Because of its seductive ways, it's known for being involved in <b>extramarital affairs</b> and disrupting the ideals of <b>familial responsibility</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Foster, 'Haunting Modernity', pg. 7" data-source="foster"></a></sup> </p>

			<p>In <b>Korean</b> folklore, the fox spirit is called the <i><b>kumiho</b></i>, who also appears as a beautiful woman in order to seduce men. They are described as "<b>cunning</b> and <b>evil</b>", and <b>gains a tail</b> for every 100 years it lives. Once it eventually has <b>nine tails</b>, the fox-spirit gains the ability to transform into a human.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="'Creepy Liver-Eating Fox Ladies', pg. 35" data-source="kumiho" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<p>One of the most popular tales of the <i>kumiho</i> which demonstrates the <b>negative femininity</b> often associated with these fox-spirits is the story of the <b>Fox Girl</b>. The story follows a family who greatly <b>wishes to have a daughter</b> but only has sons. They finally give birth a daughter and she grows to adolescence, at which point their <b>livestock begin to die</b>. One day the son witnesses the daughter reaching into a <b>cow's stomach</b> and <b>pulling out its liver</b> to <b>eat it</b>. The father however <b>refuses to believe</b> the son's testimony, and eventually she kills her parents and the rest of the animals, having been possessed by a fox-spirit. This story exemplifies the fox spirit as an "<b>evil feminine force</b>" and aims to teach <b>Confucian ideals</b>, implying that the family was wrong to <b>give preference to the daughter</b> and rather than the son.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="'Creepy Liver-Eating Fox Ladies', pg. 35-36" data-source="kumiho" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

			<!-- MAGIC & SHAPESHIFTING -->
			<h3 id="magic">Magic & Shapeshifting</h3>
			<img src="media/magic.svg" alt="fire" width="160px">

			<p>Another theme we see associated with the fox is its ability for <b>magic</b> and in particular <b>shapeshifting</b> magic. We can see this in the fox's ability to <b>transform into a woman</b> in the <b>East Asian</b> tradition as well as in some <b>European fairy tales</b> featuring the magical abilities of the fox as it <b>helps the hero</b>.</p>

			<h5>- Fox Spirits in East Asia -</h5>

			<p>As we saw with the <i><b>huli jing</b></i> from Chinese folklore, fox-spirits were thought to possess certain kinds of magic and power, usually embodying the <b>negative</b>, <b>evil</b>, and <b>feminine</b> <i><b>yin</b></i> energy rather than the <b>positive</b>, <b>virtuous</b>, and <b>masculine</b> <i><b>yang</b></i> energy. Through <b>possession</b>, fox-spirits could create <b>illusions and hallucinations</b>, causing people to "<b>go mad</b>, <b>talk nonsense</b>, and <b>laugh and wail uncontrollably</b>."<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Kang, <i>Foxes in Early Chinese Tradition</i>, pg. 18" data-source="kang" target="_blank"></a></sup> The Japanese <i><b>kitsune</b></i> is similarly described to have the ability to <b>possess people or places</b>, and various kinds of <b>erratic behavior</b> or physical <b>illnesses</b> could be diagnosed as fox-possession.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Foster, 'Haunting Modernity', pg. 7" data-source="foster"></a></sup> The fox spirits from East Asian traditions also share in their ability for <b>transforming</b> into a beautiful woman, as previously discussed, and these themes of <b>fluidity</b> and <b>shapeshifting</b> can be seen in certain <b>European fairy tales</b> as well.</p>

			<div class="quote fancy-border">"When a fox is fifty years old, it can <b>transform itself into a woman</b>; when a hundred years old, it becomes a beautiful female, or a spirit medium, or an adult male who has <b>sexual intercourse</b> with women.

			<h5>- European Fairy Tales -</h5>

			<p>In a number of Euopean fairy tales we also see the fox function as a <b>helper</b> to the <b>hero</b>, offering <b>advice</b> and <b>magical abilities</b> to help him on his quest. The role of helper isn't distinct to the fox in these stories though, and in many stories the fox is one of a number of <b>animal helpers</b>, typically <b>the last one</b> who brings the quest or task to completion. In one story, the fox leaves the hero <b>a hair from his fur</b> and the fox will come running to his aid when he <b>rubs the strand</b> of hair. We also see tales involving <b>shapeshifting</b> magic. One story tells of a fox who grants the hero the ability to <b>transform into a fox</b> in return for the hero's help <b>freeing the fox</b> from a trap. Another involves the fox <b>changing the hero into an animal</b> or <b>hiding him underground</b> to avoid discovery.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Uther, <i>The Fox in World Literature</i>, pg. 150" data-source="uther" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>

In some languages, we have different words for <b>male</b> and <b>female</b> foxes (e.g. <i>fox</i> and <i>vixen</i> in English, <i>Fuchs</i> and <i>Fuchsin</i> in German), while other languages don't make any distinctions between the two. We also see terms like <i><b>foxy</b></i> in English being used to describe someone who is either <b>cunning</b> or <b>sexually attractive</b>, especially for <b>women</b>. A <i>silver fox</i> can also be used to denote an <b>older individual</b> who is <b>sexually attractive</b>.</p>

			<p>There are a number of <b>folk etymologies</b> for the Latin word <i><b>vulpēs</b></i> meaning "fox". One proposes that it comes from <i><b>volvō</b></i> ("to roll") and <i><b>pēs</b></i> ("foot") because foxes don't travel in a <b>straight or direct path</b>.<sup><a class="citation sources-citation" data-tooltip="Theobaldus, <i>Physiologus</i>, pg. 77" data-source="theobaldus" target="_blank"></a></sup> Another idea was that the word comes from <i>volat</i> ("to fly") and <i>pēs</i> ("foot"), because they <b>fly on their feet</b> in how swift they are.<sup><a class="citation" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/varro-latin_language/1938/pb_LCL333.97.xml" data-tooltip="Varro, <i>On the Latin Language</i>" data-source="varro" target="_blank"></a></sup></p>
